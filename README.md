# Angular Starter Kit

Angular Starter Kit is a robust web application scaffold built using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building modern, dynamic web applications. This project was generated with Angular CLI version 16.2.4 and is designed to help developers kickstart their Angular projects efficiently.

## Features

Angular Starter Kit comes pre-configured with a set of features and tools to enhance your development experience:

- **Development Server**: Start a development server by running `npm start`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view your application. It will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

- **Production Build**: Create a production-ready build by running `npm run build:prod`.

- **Code Scaffolding**: Generate Angular components, directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules with ease using `ng generate` commands.

- **Unit Testing**: Execute unit tests with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) using the command `npm test`.

- **Linting**: Ensure code quality with linting using `npm run lint`.

- **Formatting**: Format your code using Prettier with `npm run format:write`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Angular Starter Kit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`. This command will automatically open the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured layout to maintain organization and readability:

- **src**: Contains your application's source code.
- **dist**: Stores the build artifacts.
- **node_modules**: Houses project dependencies.
- **package.json**: Lists project metadata and dependencies.
- **README.md**: Provides essential information about the project.

## Dependencies

Angular Starter Kit leverages various libraries and packages to streamline development:

- Angular and Angular CLI
- Angular Material
- RxJS
- NgRx for state management
- Zone.js
- Other utility libraries like UUID

## Scripts

We have defined several npm scripts to simplify common development tasks:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build:prod`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm test`: Executes unit tests.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase.
- `npm run format:write`: Formats code using Prettier.

For more details on these scripts and their usage, refer to the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli).
